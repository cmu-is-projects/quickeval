quickeval.org Source Code!

How do I get running?:
0. create a mysql database named quickeval (remember the credentials you use!)
1. run the db/quickeval.sql script against the new database
2. copy www/.htaccess.example and rename www/.htaccess
3. make necessary changes in .htaccess (they are commented)
4. copy lib/config.yaml.example and rename lib/config.yaml
5. make all changes in config.yaml (they are also commented - you'll need the DB login info from 0.)
6. point MAMP/WAMP/whatever to the quickeval/www root (www root, not quickeval root)
7. default login is test@test.com/test

Directory Structure:
/db - login information - strictly informative
/lib - library for PHP functions
/templates - templates for the site
/test - test cases for the library classes
/www - public html directory

testing on development:
phpunit --configuration devphpunit.xml
